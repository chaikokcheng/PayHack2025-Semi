   ```

2. **FAQ Section**
   ```typescript
   // Add common questions:
   - How does offline payment work?
   - Is it secure?
   - What happens if I lose my phone?
   ```

### B. Technical Deep Dive

**Current Issue**: No technical details for developers

**Suggested Improvements**:

1. **API Documentation**

   ```typescript
   // Show API endpoints:
   - Request/response examples
   - Authentication details
   - Error handling
   ```

2. **Architecture Diagram**
   ```typescript
   // Visual system architecture:
   - Component relationships
   - Data flow
   - Security layers
   ```
